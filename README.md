# Biometric Security Project with PyFingerprint 🔍
## Overview

Hello! Our project is a program that encrypts and decrypts a user's fingerprint using a CoAP server in combination with the PyFingerprint library. Specifically, we've implemented hybrid asymmetric/symetric encryption into our program as is it widely used for secure online communication.

Futhermore, we attempted to break into our own program using a mold of a current fingerprint stored in the database which is seen in the demo. Spoiler alert, *we got in!* 😉
