# Biometric Security Project with PyFingerprint 🔍
## Overview

Hello! Our project is a program that encrypts and decrypts a user's fingerprint using a CoAP server in combination with the PyFingerprint library. Specifically, we've implemented asymmetric encryption into our program as is it widely used for secure online communication. Additional steps we took include checking the security of the encrypted transfer of information through Wireshark. Wireshark ensured messages were thoroughly encrypted and could not easily be intercepted by malicious users. 

Futhermore, we attempted to break into our own program using a mold of a current fingerprint stored in the database which is seen in the demo. Spoiler alert, *we got in!* 😉
