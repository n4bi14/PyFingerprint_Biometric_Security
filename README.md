# Biometric Security Project with PyFingerprint 🔍
## Overview

Hello! Our project is a program that encrypts and decrypts a user's fingerprint using a CoAP server in combination with the PyFingerprint library. Specifically, we've implemented hybrid asymmetric/symetric encryption into our program as is it widely used for secure online communication.
